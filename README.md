The Composer Asset Plugin allows you to manage project assets (css,js, etc) in your composer.json
without installing NPM or Bower.

This plugin works by transposing package information from NPM or Bower to a compatible version for Composer.
This allows you to manage asset dependencies in a PHP based project very easily.

> **Warning!**
>
> Currently the plugin only works in "global" mode, the PR [#3082](https://github.com/composer/composer/pull/3082)
> will allow the plugin to work in "project" mode

##### Why this plugin?

There already are several possibilities for managing assets in a PHP project:

1. Install Node.js and use NPM or Bower command line in addition to Composer command line
2. Do #1, but add Composer scripts to automate the process
3. Include assets directly in the project (not recommended)
4. Create a repository with all assets and include the `composer.json` file (and use Packagist or an VCS Repository)
5. Add a package repository in `composer.json` with a direct download link
6. Create a Satis or Packagist server
7. Other?

It goes without saying that each javascript, css, etc library should be developed with the usual tools for that
language, which front-end developers know well. However, in the case of a complete project in PHP, it shouldn't 
be necessary to use several tools (php, nodejs, composer, npm, bower, grunt, etc...) to simply install
these assets in your project.

This plugin has been created to address these issues. Additionally, most developers will not a add a composer.json 
file to their projects just to support php based projects, especially when npm and/or bower already exist and are
widely used.
